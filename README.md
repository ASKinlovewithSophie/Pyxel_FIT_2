# Pyxel_FIT_2 Project & Assignments by my crush, ROCI, all in Pyxel with a pixel dimensions of (200, 200)

#1 b_9.2.1 is a game with a score count at top left corner.
Balls are released from the top at a speed, and the angle would be between 30 and 150 degrees.
The board use to catch the ball is 40 pixels wide.
Sounds played when the ball got catched or missed.

#2 b_10.2.4 is an updated version of b_9.2.1. via following updates:
1. 3 balls released from top at once.
2. Auto-pausing mechanism added once 10 balls in-total are missed.
3. Miss count added right under the score count.
